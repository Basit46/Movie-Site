# Movie App

This is an assessment project where I was to recreate a site from figma to React.
In this project, I used OMDB API was used to as the API.

I used the following:

* React JS
* Tailwind CSS
* OMDB API
* Axios
* React-Icons
* useContext, useState and UseEffect Hooks

It contains three main sections

1. Assets: This is where I stored images and external materials

2. hooks: Contains my useContext hooks

3. Components: It has two sections which are "main" and "mini"
   The main includes: the main components such as the navbar, hero section, etc 
   the mini includes: the components that are repeated such as the movie components etc.
